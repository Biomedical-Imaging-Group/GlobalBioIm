Welcome to the GlobalBioIm Library Webpage
******************************************

This is a free Matlab library. It contains generic modules that facilitate the implementation of forward models and optimization
algorithms. It also capitalizes on the
strong commonalities between the various image-formation models that can be exploited to build a fast, 
streamlined code.
